			"While rival muscle cars have pivoted recently toward sharp handling, the 2023 Dodge Challenger keeps things retro with a package that’s designed more for old-school pony-car jollies and straight-line speed. A V-6 engine is standard in these non-SRT Challengers but the real fun comes with the optional naturally aspirated Hemi V-8 engines, which are offered in a variety of displacements and outputs spanning a 375-hp, 5.7-liter to a 485-hp, 6.4-liter. If you want even more power, Dodge will be happy to oblige with the big-stomper Challenger SRT Hellcat, which we review separately. The regular Challenger isn’t as intense as the outrageous Hellcat, but for some its V-8 burble and relatively comfortable ride will be enough to trigger nostalgic feelings for the vintage Dodge pony cars with which it shares a name.",

			"If you avoid the pricier trims and engines, the Volkswagen T-Roc is a fine buy. Its hushed refinement makes it one of the most comfortable cars in the class, while its spacious interior and big boot will appeal to families. Also, its high-set driving position is just what SUV buyers crave – and something many other small SUVs fail to deliver. Entry-level Life trim is our pick of the bunch, because it keeps costs down while also coming with plenty of standard equipment. That includes 16in alloy wheels, automatic LED headlights, automatic front windscreen wipers, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, two-zone climate control, adaptive cruise control, adjustable lumbar support, an 8.0in digital driver display and a 6.25in touchscreen infotainment system with Bluetooth, DAB radio and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smartphone mirroring.",

			"Exceptionally sporty and exceedingly luxurious, the E43 has been transformed by AMG from a regular E-Class sedan into an equilibrium of excellence by adding a specially tuned 396-hp twin-turbo V-6 and a nine-speed automatic transmission. This sophisticated cruiser also features standard air suspension and all-wheel drive for adroit handling. The E43 boasts an assertive exterior and an extravagant interior that is equally high tech and high class, with exotic materials and a fully digitized dashboard. For blending all of these attributes in an irresistible fashion, the E43 finds itself on our list of 10Best Cars for 2018. Mercedes-AMG built a nearly flawless sports sedan with the debut of the E43 in 2017. It checked all the boxes of what constitutes performance and class. That winning combination is enough for the company to send it into 2018 with a single change: black leatherette upholstery with red stitching is now standard.",

			"The A5 Sportback is a great-looking, fun-handling, smooth-driving premium sedan that isn’t as aggressive as the 349-hp S5 Sportback, which we review separately. As an lengthened version of the A5 coupe and convertible, the A5 Sportback uses an identical powertrain setup with a turbocharged inline-four bolted to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. A5 Sportback 40 model has 201 horsepower and 236 pound-feet of torque, while A5 Sportback 45 model gains an additional 60 horsepower and 40 pound-feet of torque. A rich breadth of standard niceties such as high-quality leather, a panoramic sunroof, and moody ambient lighting make even the base A5 Sportback feel plush. While rivals such as the Mercedes-Benz C-class or Genesis G70 have arguably more stylish interiors, the Sportback’s is butressed by an incredibly clear and high-tech digital gauge display with available navigation handled by Google Earth imagery.",

			"Few cars are capable of serving the gods of both comfort and sportiness as well as the 2023 BMW 3-series sedan. This perennial favorite can be outfitted as a corner-carving sports sedan or a well-appointed entry-luxury car—or a combination of both. Its three available turbocharged powertrains deftly walk the line between power and polish. The entry-level 330i and plug-in hybrid 330e offer impressive performance with above average fuel economy, while the turbocharged inline-six in the top-dog M340i packs 382 of the biggest, strongest horses this side of the Bavarian Alps. The 3-series doesn’t have the style of the Alfa Romeo Giulia or the value-packed features list of the Genesis G70, but it’s so well-rounded, athletic, and engaging to drive that it stands at the very top of our segment rankings. BMW’s quintessential sports sedan gets a tech-heavy makeover for 2023 that sees updated exterior styling and a dramatic new all-digital dashboard. Keen eyes will notice that this same monolithic display that stretches two-thirds of the 3-series’s dashboard is the same design as what you’ll find in the brand’s flagship 7-series and electric iX SUV. The wall of screens runs BMW’s iDrive 8 interface and includes standard navigation, a voice assistant, and a 5G Wi-FI hotspot.",

			"The BMW 1 Series has been a staple contender among premium family hatchback for many years, appealing to anyone looking to mix practicality with a dose of glamour. This latest, third-generation 1 Series has one big change that's upset a few enthusiasts, though – it's driven by its front wheels rather than being rear-wheel drive. However, for most buyers, that's actually made it a far more accomplished family car. åYou see, the truth is, previous generations of the BMW 1 Series weren’t as good to drive as the 'Ultimate Driving Machine' hype suggested anyway, with only more powerful (and expensive) versions able to take full advantage of the rear-wheel-drive layout. åOn this latest model, BMW gives you a choice of petrol and diesel engines, and you can get four-wheel drive for extra road-holding on some of the pricier versions. Indeed, many of the mechanicals are taken from the BMW X1 and BMW X2 hatchbacks. åHere, we'll be finding out how the BMW 1 Series stacks up against a range of alternatives, such as the Audi A3 and Mercedes A-Class – as well as more mainstream alternatives, including the Mazda 3 and Volkswagen Golf. We'll also tell you which engine and trim combination make the most sense.",

		description:
			"The 2023 Range Rover Evoque is the fashionista of the subcompact-SUV class, and it’s guaranteed to turn heads. Unfortunately, its practical attributes don't measure up to those of the segment’s leaders. Neither its cargo capacity nor interior space are as generous as in rivals such as the BMW X1, Mercedes-Benz GLB-class, and Volvo XC40. Those SUVs also provide more driving enjoyment than the Evoque. The Evoque offers a choice of two turbocharged four-cylinder engines but neither will save you much at the pump, as their fuel efficiency is mediocre. Ultimately, the Evoque's charm lies in its eye-catching design, tailored cabin, and luxury-brand cachet. Plus, its tall seating position gives it a more SUV-like feel than some lower-riding rivals. The Evoque is powered by a 246-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder dubbed P250, and it comes standard with a nine-speed automatic and all-wheel drive. At our test track, the Evoque delivered a 7.1-second zero-to-60-mph run. Rivals such as the BMW X1 and the Volvo XC40 delivered slightly quicker times, but the Land Rover is still competitively lively. The more powerful P300 powertrain is limited to the top-spec HST R-Dynamic. That engine makes a stout 296 horsepower and is assisted by a 48-volt hybrid system; at our test track the P300 managed a 6.6-second zero-to-60-mph time. On the road, there's no mistaking the Evoque for a hatchback car as you can with the X1. It feels substantial, and the seat height is SUV appropriate; it handles corners adequately but won't satisfy enthusiast drivers in the same way as the BMW or Mercedes-Benz GLA-class.",

			"With designer looks and twin-turbo power, the 2022 ferrari brings a ton of Italian attitude to the mid-size luxury sedan party. Four-cylinder engines be damned, the Ghibli offers a 345-hp twin-turbo V-6 as standard while upper trims come with either a 424-hp version of that engine or a 580-hp twin-turbo V-8. To go along with its powerful engines, the Ghibli's chassis is set up for driving thrills—it's a joy to pitch down a curvy back road. Unfortunately, it may be too focused on fun, as the Ghibli doesn't stack up well against rivals in the luxury and comfort categories, as its rear seat is less accommodating than rivals such as the Audi A6 or the Mercedes-Benz E-class. A host of leather, wood, and metal trims dot the Ghibli's cabin to upscale effect, but several knobs and switches appear to be lifted directly from the Stellantis (Maserati's parent company) parts bin. Still, the Maserati's styling and performance make it endearing, plus its relative obscurity means it turns heads like Italian exotics from Ferrari and Lamborghini. Maserati has simplified the Ghibli's lineup for 2022 and created three distinct trim levels, starting with the 345-hp GT, then graduating to the 424-hp Modena and then the beastly 580-hp Trofeo. The GT presents a more luxury-oriented design while the Modena and Trofeo lean heavily on more aggressive design themes to project their performance. The Ghibli now comes standard with a host of driver-assistance features, including adaptive cruise control and automated emergency braking.",

			"Cats are solitary creatures, and true to form, lamborghini has only one gasoline-powered sedan in its lineup now amid the massive popularity of SUVs and a looming push toward electrification. The XF sticks around for another lap around the sun but is long overdue for a redesign to help it compete against newer sedans such as the Mercedes-Benz E-class, Genesis G80, and Audi A7. Meanwhile, the XF P250 comes standard with rear-wheel drive, an eight-speed automatic transmission, and a 246-hp turbocharged four-cylinder engine. The P300 version boosts output to 296 hp and is strictly an all-wheel-drive model. While the XF’s powertrain offerings are limited in size and power, its price makes it the most affordable entry in the mid-size-luxury-car segment. Its interior features handsome materials has plenty of tech, and the XF combines the plushness and ride of a big sedan with surefooted handling. Its maneuverability at reasonable speeds is downright catlike. Unfortunately, it’s not enough; this feline is clearly showing its age. The XF is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that comes in two potencies. The P250 version produces 246 horsepower, and the P300 generates 296 horses. Both engines mate to an eight-speed automatic transmission, but only the less powerful one offers rear- or all-wheel drive. The P300 comes exclusively with all-wheel drive. While we haven't had the opportunity to test both versions at the track, we have driven the more powerful one. It hit 60 mph in 6.2 seconds, which is slower than the now-defunct supercharged V-6 model, but the Jag's exhaust still sounds good. We appreciated the Jag's supple suspension, which delivered fluid handling along with exceptional ride quality. The XF's steering transitioned adeptly between low-speed lightness and high-speed heft. The soft brake pedal had a gradual response, too.",
